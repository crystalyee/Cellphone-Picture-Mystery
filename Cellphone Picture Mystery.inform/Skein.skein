After taking a look around, the Stranger sees that there is no where to run and resigns himself to his fate.
 &quot;What are the chances that we&apos;d end up here&quot; he mutters to himself as you walk towards him.
&quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask.
&quot;What?!?&quot;
&quot;I swear, I never even met you but you keep on running away.&quot;
    &quot;…&quot;        &quot;I think I lost my memory but for some reason I have pictures of you in my phone. Do you have any idea about who I am?&quot;        &quot;I see… You are not someone I know personally I am not against cooperating with you to get out of this place.椄整o I am&quot;    You agree to cooperate with the stranger.
&quot;By the way, my name is Landon, Landon Meyers.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Detective Jowd put you on the case to catch the prime suspect in the February Killings. What was his name again? Meyers something… Brandon maybe?&quot;



    *** And so you continue your life looking for the elusive Brandon, alleged murderer in the February Killings and the one who stole your memories. (If you choose to play the game again, try interacting with Landon more) ***


In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 83 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?
