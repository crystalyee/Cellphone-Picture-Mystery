&quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask.
&quot;What?!?&quot;
&quot;I swear, I never even met you but you keep on running away.&quot;
    &quot;…&quot;        &quot;I think I lost my memory but for some reason I have pictures of you in my phone. Do you have any idea about who I am?&quot;        &quot;I see… You are not someone I know personally I am not against cooperating with you to get out of this place. †&quot;    You agree to cooperate with the stranger.

&quot;I swear, I never even met you but you keep on running away.&quot;
