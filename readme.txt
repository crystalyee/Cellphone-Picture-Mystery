The game as it is now doesn't reflect my original intentions. I wanted to make a game with puzzles that really made you think like in a mystery. You'd know a place is the same place as in the picture based on minor details like the type of tree in the area. And chances are, you wouldn't know any of this until combing over the available information several times over. And I had it like that tooâ€¦ but then people complained about it being too frustrating so I had to dumb it down.  

I was stuck for the longest time on conditionals. After writing a conditional "If blah blah blah" and finishing the conditional, "Otherwise" or "Else if" is required before writing other conditions. I actually thought that my conditionals were fine and that Inform had a problem with my item status, so I asked Mrs. Kiang about the problem, and she found the error in a completely different area. 

The first puzzle is acquiring a saw. The saw isn't hard to get to at all. It's just lying in the Pine Tree Trail undescribed, so you could technically pick it up at any time. The problem is that you don't know it's there unless you've examined the bush, and you don't know the bush exists until you've examined photo 3. 

The second puzzle is getting the stranger to talk to you. If you try to talk to him, you end up chasing him around in a circle. To trap him, you have to cut the bridge down and block his escape route using the saw you've acquired in the first puzzle. 

The third puzzle is unlocking the gate. To do this you must both have the keycard with you and input a code into the lock. If you talk to the NPC he'll give you the keycard. To get the code for the lock, the player has to look in the contacts menu and find their phone number. The code is the last four digits of the player's number. 

From here if you interact with the NPC, Landon over 3 times, the ending changes. Simple things like asking Landon about himself or giving him the daisy you found in the grassy meadow increases friendship. Sometimes these conversations drop hints about your past. These extras include:
ask Landon about Landon
ask Landon about Me
ask Landon about running
ask Landon about bridge
show photo 3 to Landon
show telescope to Landon
give daisy to Landon

One mechanic I introduced is having Landon follow you after you've talked to him. I think it gives the player the feeling that they're working with someone instead of by themselves. I think that having a really interactive involved character to interact with makes the game more personal. 

Before Brianna beta tested my game I asked a few of my friends to play it. In general I made the puzzles a lot more obvious and added a lot of synonyms. 

I beta tested Brianna's game. I mostly gave feedback on making exits to rooms more obvious and I found a bug where something that definitely was supposed to be scenery was an item. 

I'm kinda proud of the game's story. 

I wish I had the ability to incorporate proving Landon's innocence into direct gameplay. 

Next time I want to make the setting an area with more physical obstacles. My rooms didn't really enhance gameplay.
